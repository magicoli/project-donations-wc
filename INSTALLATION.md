## Installation

* Install as usual (download and unzip in wp-content/plugins/ folder, then activate)
* Create a product, check "Project Product" option
* Set product price to zero, or to a minimum amount
* You would probably also activate "Virtual" option

The product page will display "Project" and "Amount" fields
To create a link for a specific project, add "project" parameter to the URL, like:

https://magiiic.com/donate/project/?project=Project+Donations+plugin

You can also specify an amount in the URL, like:

https://magiiic.com/donate/project/?project=Project+Donations+plugin&amount=5
