Add project field to WooCommerce products, allow clients to link their purchase to a project

## Description

Collect donations for different projects with a WooCommerce product.

If you are like me, you work on several projects and would like to simply collect donations for them, without bothering creating and configuring a product for each project.

This plugin is mostly intended to be easy to set up. It is mostly usefull if you want to get donations and need or already use WooCommerce platform.

### Features

- switch to enable any product as Project Donation
- **add project field** on enabled product page, with
  - with free type project name
  - or drop down selection list (from project or another post type)
- optionally **add "Project" post type** to WordPress (if needed and not provided by another plugin)
- optionally replace fixed price with a **flexible Amount field** (if not provided by another plugin). When the product has a fixed price higher than zero, the donation amount will be added to the normal product price)
- **compatible with subscriptions, variable products**, and probably any other WooCommerce product type
- **compatible with WooCommerce Name Your Price** (although main features are included in Project Donations)
- localization ready

### Roadmap
